Tea, Earl Grey, Hot.

Creating an offline on-device Smart-Home voice assistant with Node.js and [Picovoice](https://picovoice.ai)

This is an implementation of replicator-client in python, targeted towards deployment on a Raspberry Pi Zero W

For the most part, this implementation follows the concepts of the original Node.js implementation, check here: https://github.com/tziegler-tud/replicator-client 
### How it works
I will add some documentation here when more progress is made. For now, check out https://github.com/tziegler-tud/replicator for information.
